# KoreAI: A KMP Library for AI Agents & Assistants

<img src="readme_images/banner.png" height="450">

> **Note**
> This library, its APIs, and the sample client applications are in Alpha.
> It may change incompatibly and require manual migration in the future.
> If you have any issues, please report them on [GitHub](https://github.com/socket-link/kore-ai/issues).

## 📔 Project Overview

- KoreAI provides a Kotlin Multiplatform library for creating & managing **Agent** and **Assistant** Chatbot definitions
  - **Agents** provide specialized knowledge on top of Chat Completion, allowing for specialized knowledge to be given for answering prompts with non-trivial questions
  - **Assistants** are a Meta-Agent; they specialize in planning complex tasks, and in delegating work to any **Agents** that they can create
- This library uses [`openai-kotlin`](https://github.com/aallam/openai-kotlin/tree/main) to implement the Agent/Assistant functionality using OpenAI

### 🥷🏻 Agents

- An **Agent** is a specialized AI Chatbot that has specialized knowledge toward solving a well-defined task.
- It is initialized with a preset `System Prompt`, which explains the mindset that the Agent should have toward answering the User.
- Initialization also includes a starting `User Prompt`, which can also utilize the `HumanAssisted` API to allow for dynamic input from the User.

#### [Bundled Agents](https://github.com/socket-link/kore-ai/tree/main/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/link/socket/kore/model/agent/bundled)

- `Save File Agent`
- `Modify File Agent`
- `Generate Code Agent`
- `Fix JSON Agent`
- `Generate Sub-Agent Agent`
- `Family Agent` (used as an example)

### 🧑🏻‍🏫 Assistants

> **Note**
> The Assistant capabilities are not yet integrated to the library. *Please stay tuned*, as this functionality
> is essential toward the core purpose of this framework.

- An **Assistant** is a type of **Agent** that has a `System Prompt` to explain how to delegate tasks, including how to spawn **Sub-Agents** to seek specialized responses.

## 📦 Setup

> **Warning**
> You need a Mac with macOS to write and run iOS-specific code on simulated or real devices.
> This is an Apple requirement.

To work with this template, you need the following:

* A machine running a recent version of macOS
* [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* The [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile)

### Check your environment

Before you start, use the [KDoctor](https://github.com/Kotlin/kdoctor) tool to ensure that your development environment
is configured correctly:

1. Install KDoctor with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

    ```text
    brew install kdoctor
    ```

2. Run KDoctor in your terminal:

    ```text
    kdoctor
    ```

   If everything is set up correctly, you'll see valid output:

   ```text
   Environment diagnose (to see all details, use -v option):
   [✓] Operation System
   [✓] Java
   [✓] Android Studio
   [✓] Xcode
   [✓] Cocoapods
   
   Conclusion:
     ✓ Your system is ready for Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile development!
   ```

Otherwise, KDoctor will highlight which parts of your setup still need to be configured and will suggest a way to fix
them.

## ⚡️ Getting Started

Open the project in Android Studio and switch the view from **Android** to **Project** to see all the files and targets
belonging to the project:

<img src="readme_images/open_project_view.png" height="300px">

Your Compose Multiplatform project includes 4 modules:

### `shared`

This is a Kotlin module that contains the logic common for desktop, Android, and iOS applications, that is, the code you
share between platforms.

This `shared` module is also where you'll write your Compose Multiplatform code.
In `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/App.kt`, you can find the shared root `@Composable` function for your app.

It uses Gradle as the build system. You can add dependencies and change settings in `shared/build.gradle.kts`.
The `shared` module builds into a Java library, an Android library, and an iOS framework.

### `desktopApp`

This is a Kotlin module that builds into a desktop application. It uses Gradle as the build system. The `desktopApp`
module depends on and uses the `shared` module as a regular library.

### `androidApp`

This is a Kotlin module that builds into an Android application. It uses Gradle as the build system.
The `androidApp` module depends on and uses the `shared` module as a regular Android library.

### `iosApp`

This is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application.
It depends on and uses the `shared` module as a CocoaPods dependency.

## ℹ️ Sample Client Applications

### Desktop

To run your desktop application in Android Studio, select `desktopApp` in the list of run configurations and click **Run**:

#### Running on a real iOS device

You can run your Compose Multiplatform application on a real iOS device for free.
To do so, you'll need the following:

* The `TEAM_ID` associated with your [Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204316)
* The iOS device registered in Xcode

> **Note**
> Before you continue, we suggest creating a simple "Hello, world!" project in Xcode to ensure you can successfully run
> apps on your device.
> You can follow the instructions below or watch
> this [Stanford CS193P lecture recording](https://youtu.be/bqu6BquVi2M?start=716&end=1399).

<details>
<summary>How to create and run a simple project in Xcode</summary>

##### Finding your Team ID

In the terminal, run `kdoctor --team-ids` to find your Team ID.
KDoctor will list all Team IDs currently configured on your system, for example:

```text
3ABC246XYZ (Max Sample)
ZABCW6SXYZ (SampleTech Inc.)
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative way to find your Team ID</summary>

If KDoctor doesn't work for you, try this alternative method:

1. In Android Studio, run the `iosApp` configuration with the selected real device. The build should fail.
2. Go to Xcode and select **Open a project or file**.
3. Navigate to the `iosApp/iosApp.xcworkspace` file of your project.
4. In the left-hand menu, select `iosApp`.
5. Navigate to **Signing & Capabilities**.
6. In the **Team** list, select your team.

If you haven't set up your team yet, use the **Add account** option and follow the steps.

</details>

To run the application, set the `TEAM_ID`:

1. In the template, navigate to the `iosApp/Configuration/Config.xcconfig` file.
2. Set your `TEAM_ID`.
3. Re-open the project in Android Studio. It should show the registered iOS device in the `iosApp` run configuration.

## How to configure the iOS application

To get a better understanding of this template's setup and learn how to configure the basic properties of your iOS app without Xcode,
open the `iosApp/Configuration/Config.xcconfig` file in Android Studio. The configuration file contains:

* `APP_NAME`, a target executable and an application bundle name.
* `BUNDLE_ID`,
  which [uniquely identifies the app throughout the system](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleidentifier#discussion).
* `TEAM_ID`, [a unique identifier generated by Apple that's assigned to your team](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/manage-your-team/locate-your-team-id/#:~:text=A%20Team%20ID%20is%20a,developer%20in%20App%20Store%20Connect).

To configure the `APP_NAME` option, open `Config.xcconfig` in any text editor *before opening* the project in Android
Studio, and then set the desired name.

If you need to change this option after you open the project in Android Studio, do the following:

1. Close the project in Android Studio.
2. Run `./cleanup.sh` in your terminal.
3. Change the setting.
4. Open the project in Android Studio again.

To configure advanced settings, use Xcode. After opening the project in Android Studio,
open the `iosApp/iosApp.xcworkspace` file in Xcode and make changes there.
