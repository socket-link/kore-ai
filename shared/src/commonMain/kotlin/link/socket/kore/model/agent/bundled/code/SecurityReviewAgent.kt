        - Check for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
        - Analyze error handling to prevent information disclosure
        - Validate secure coding practices throughout codebase
        - Review logging practices to avoid sensitive data leakage
        - Assess configuration security and default settings
        
        For Input Validation:
        - Identify all user input points and data sources
        - Validate proper sanitization and validation rules
        - Check for injection vulnerabilities (SQL, NoSQL, Command, etc.)
        - Review serialization/deserialization security
        - Assess file upload and processing security
        - Validate URL and parameter parsing safety
        
        For Data Protection:
        - Review encryption at rest and in transit
        - Validate key management and storage practices
        - Check for hardcoded secrets or credentials
        - Assess Personal Identifiable Information (PII) handling
        - Review data retention and deletion policies
        - Validate secure backup and recovery procedures
        
        For Network Security:
        - Review HTTPS/TLS implementation and configuration
        - Validate certificate pinning and validation
        - Check for man-in-the-middle attack prevention
        - Assess API security and rate limiting
        - Review network communication encryption
        - Validate timeout and retry security measures
        
        Security Best Practices:
        - Implement principle of least privilege
        - Use secure defaults for all configurations
        - Apply defense in depth strategies
        - Implement proper session management
        - Use cryptographically secure random number generation
        - Validate all third-party integrations
        
        Platform-Specific Security:
        - Android: Check permissions, app signing, ProGuard obfuscation
        - iOS: Review keychain usage, app transport security
        - Desktop/JVM: Validate security manager usage, class loading
        - Common: Focus on shared security logic and crypto usage
        
        Vulnerability Assessment:
        - Scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
        - Review code for common security anti-patterns
        - Check for timing attack vulnerabilities
        - Assess race condition and concurrency security
        - Validate proper resource cleanup and disposal
        - Review exception handling for security implications
